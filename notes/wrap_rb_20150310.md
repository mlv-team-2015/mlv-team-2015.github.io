hello today is Mar 10 2015.
this is the story of ....

BOK SANDBOX!!

i started off the day by exploring with marlon some of the potential uses of 3D animations for the web, as well as examples of data visualizations.

we took a look at [3D models](https://www.verold.com/).....
as well as the NYT [american time use survey](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html).....
and came up with a couple of strategies for the sandbox website!

the idea is to explore the use of embedded video, perhaps incorporating parallax scrolling. 

well i'm getting ahead of myself.

First I set up a [MLV Team 2015](https://github.com/mlv-team-2015) github organization and initialized a [Github Pages](http://mlv-team-2015.github.io/index.html) website....

it's looking pretty sparse so far, but at least it's a beginning.

Next I took a look at some different approaches to 3D modeling on the web.

GrabCAD developer [Blake Courter](http://blakecourter.com/) has a fun website that uses many of the technologies that we will need....
....namely [.obj files](https://github.com/bcourter/four.js/tree/master/resources/obj) that can be produced in Cinema 4D

The main technology for this type of site is a library called [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)

I took a look at some examples of code that use three.js to [import object files](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/js/loaders/OBJLoader.js).

I'm looking forward to trying this out with some in-house animations!

Next I started to dissect parallax scrolling....

People on ["the internet" seem to think](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22188355/parallax-scroll-effect-with-video) that video files can't be handled in the same way that jQuery handles images. But we shall see.  

[The Most Northern Place](http://www.themostnorthernplace.com/) seems to have no trouble at all.....

....and inspection reveals that they use video files (webm and mp4) rather than gifs.

Finally, I took a look at [some options for pre-built parallax scrolling effects](http://www.vandelaydesign.com/parallax-scrolling-best-practices-examples-and-tutorials/). I think [one of these](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/) should provide a good starting point.....

[Scrolly](http://lab.victorcoulon.fr/javascript/scrolly/) seems simple and have the functionality to start diving in.

So once we have video hosted somewhere....that's where we'll start!

Thanks for watching, and have a great day :)

Cheers,
