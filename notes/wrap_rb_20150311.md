hello! today is 11 Mar 2015
and this is the story offffffff....
[AMAZON WEB SERVICES](http://aws.amazon.com/)!

Today, we spend some time configuring [AWS S3](bokmedia.signin.aws.amazon.com) cloud hosting so we could host media assets for the sandbox website.
Easier said than done...
But we did it!!

Next we spent some time exploring video embedded in web pages....
And [Three.js examples](http://threejs.org/examples/), like this [Fresnel shader](http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_shaders_fresnel).
Other examples abound.....
some are suited to the Bok center goals and some are just really fun to look at and interact with.
We spent some time exploring [how Javascript handles mouse event interactions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputEvent).....
and dove into the [documentation on Three.js texture cube](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Extras/ImageUtils.loadTextureCube) that was used in the Fresnel example....

we re-created the Fresnel example on our own sandbox site, and modified the interaction to pause and animate the bubbles....


However, we ran into more issues with AWS S3....

We need to [enable CORS for the S3 bucket](http://s3browser.com/s3-bucket-cors-configuration.php)....

...or else our live page won't load the images properly due to cross-site origin security protocols.

:/

We do have a number of precedents ready to look at and model video embeds after, once we have these hosting issues sorted out.

For example...[Frame.io](http://frame.io/) combines video embeds with parallax scrolling.

Along with [other examples](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/video-backgrounds-2131982)....







Very exciting possibilities here!

Thanks for reading!

Cheers,

RB
