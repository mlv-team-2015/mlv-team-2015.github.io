            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h2>The greatest story never told</h2>
            <p>
                What follows is a production that deftly parodies early 70s life-of-Jesus rock operas, including familiar elements like crowds gathered behind chain-link fencing, 70s-modern products like chrome floor lamps and telephone booths juxtaposed against the 1 BC Middle Eastern setting, and period-perfect music, clothes, language, and choreography. Repeated comic motifs include the use of poorly synchronized and mixed Dubbing and high, hard-rock-style vocal notes, in the manner of 70s Robert Plant or Ian Gillan, inserted incongruously and sustained for absurdly long durations.
